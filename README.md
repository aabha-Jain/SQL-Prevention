# SQL-Prevention

## Application: Food Recommendation System

## Description:

### We have to think about what to cook every single day and sometimes that gets boring. 
### This application will show the customer one item for starters, main course and desserts so that they don't have to choose.

## Aim:

### This application has been built to show how we can prevent SQL Injection, which is used to log into a profile without knowing the credentials using different keys.
